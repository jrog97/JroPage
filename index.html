        <h2> My Information</h2>
        <p>  My name is Julio Gerardo Rivera Ortiz and I was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico in 1997 and currently living in Fajardo Puerto Rico.<br> 
            My hobbies is to play video games and pass time with friends when I have the time. <br>
            I chose computer engineering because I wanted to study something that I love and have been using since I was a kid.<br> I would love to go and in a federal job and have the opportunity to work in a<br> 
            place where I feel comfortable. I had a Internship last summer in the Air Force in Georgia specifically AFB Robins. 
          <br>  I did also worked on some of html and css in the summer but didn't profound to keep since working was alot for me and I only<br> had the 
            chance to practice was in the nights, but it was very tiring thats why I chose this class to keep my interest in Internet Programming.
